Purpose
-------

Your Podcast is too popular for your web server? Your audience has
Podcast clients that support downloading via BitTorent, e.g. Miro?

servtorrent ensures that there's always a seeder by uploading
transparently from any HTTP location that supports Range requests.


Installation
------------

1. Install Erlang

2. Install ibrowse (HTTP client library)
  * git clone git://github.com/cmullaparthi/ibrowse.git
  * cd ibrowse
  * make
  * sudo ln -s `pwd` /usr/lib*/erlang/lib/ibrowse


Running
-------

1. Customize seeds.xml

2. Make sure the port specified in servtorrent.app is reachable from
   the Internet (servtorrent will not use peer info from tracker
   responses)

3. Compile and run by issuing: ./start.sh


TODO
----

* Super-seeding
* Slot queues
* PEX
* DHT support
* Support Chaos Bay web-seeding
